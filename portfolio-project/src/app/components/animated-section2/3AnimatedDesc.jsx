            My mission is to create clean, user-friendly digital experiences that make people's lives easier. Beyond code, I care deeply about authentic storytelling and design that resonates emotionallyâ€”especially through creative outlets like cartoons and digital art.<br></br><br></br>

            I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can grow as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and be part of a team that values creativity, empathy, and technical excellence.
